My MacPorts Guide QA & Documentary Notes
========================================

## Some Documentary Efforts
### Pull Request(s)

IMO the [MacPorts Guide](https://guide.macports.org/) could improve from quality assurance
(QA) and actions as follows.  Nevertheless the Guide provides excellent advice.

PR [#53](https://github.com/macports/macports-guide/pull/53)

This PR and this text could become a standing document until further notice.

Amends README.md and provides new CONTENT.md for the content list of
this folder structure (see commits). Thus aiming at better readability
for new readers and improved access to this folder for beginners like
myself.

This PR might not be fully compatible to but certainly is related to
[7.5. Updating Documentation](https://guide.macports.org/#project.docs)


### The ongoing trial to improve the MacPorts Guide Documentary
