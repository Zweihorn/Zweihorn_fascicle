Unfortunately, one [cannot ignore tribal aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication) and [any community effort](https://www.debian.org/intro/free) can degrade into [lost debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma) or other [complex issues](https://ownyourbits.com/2017/06/12/why-nextcloudpi-uses-apache-and-not-nginx/).  Naturally,  [technical and deployment aspects](https://nextcloud.com/support/) should always matter most and you are [free to choose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

### Personal

I am a proud father of five (formerly six) beautiful children. I am a proud citizen of the European Union (EU).

Born in Western Germany during the times of [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), nowadays happily living in a reunified [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) in the EU. I enjoy my life in private.

### Societal

Welcome to the [CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time) zone. In [Old Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Europe_and_New_Europe) we have a tradition of [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) like [Critique of Pure Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant).

[Berlin, Capital of Germany,](https://www.berlin.de/en/) today has good neighbours as [Paris](https://www.paris.fr/), [Amsterdam](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/) and [Warsaw](http://www.um.warszawa.pl/en) in the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market_en). :de: :eu:

While in Berlin stop at the [Berghain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berghain), the [Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe](https://www.berlin.de/en/attractions-and-sights/3560249-3104052-memorial-to-the-murdered-jews-of-europe.en.html) and the [Mauerpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauerpark). Only after the more educated [fan of space history](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/history/vonbraun/bio.html) may make a day's visit to the southern coast of the [Baltic sea](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/print_gm.html) and touch [some historic ground of rocket science and far more sad ambitions of the past](https://museum-peenemuende.de/?lang=en).
:rocket: :thinking:

## Addendum

Please note:

* [**Berlin** is both the Capital and largest city](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) of Germany by both area and population.

* _Little Berlin_ i.e. [Berlin (Seedorf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_(Seedorf)) is a civil parish in [Sleswick-Holsatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein).

* The author of this Work and document intentionally tends to spell words of the [EN locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)) like 'instalment', 'colour', 'tyre', 'optimisation' etc. in the  way of [**en-GB British English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English) specifically.

* The word **"different"** and its usage in _construction variants_ as "different _from_", "different _than_", and "different _to_": One might wonder if there are any distinctions between these three constructions, and is one more correct than the others? Evidently, in general global practice, the construction _"different **from**"_ is most common, both in British and US English, and the **most accepted** common structure.

* There is a long standing [political reason to differentiate between the United Kingdom and Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement). That's why I personally as an EU citizen prefer the use of [GB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) as common denominator.

* The book „[A Tale of Two Cities](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Conte_de_deux_cités)“ is an 1859 historical novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.

* The [Latin](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lat%C3%ADn) maxim „[de gustibus non est disputandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum)“ is _**not** a true ancient Latin adage, i.e. **not** Roman,_ but instead was transcribed from the spanish phrase „Sobre los gustos no hay disputo“ by the almost forgotten French lawyer and politician [Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Anthelme_Brillat-Savarin).  During the time of terror of the French Revolution this poor human had to emigrate and was living for two years 1795/96 in New York, in the then quite young United States of America. Later he returned to his home country France and was author of „La Physiologie du Goût“ besides some other books.

* The **right to education** has been [recognized as a human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education) in a number of international conventions, specifically as Article 26 of the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)** which was adopted by the [United Nations General Assembly at its third session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) on 10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 in Paris, France.

NOTE: **Education** certainly matters to both civilisation and democracy. There is a reason why [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is called a globe, why we talk about global warming while [hurricanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone) usually do not reach Alabama and why pigs cannot fly:

> [**Eratosthenes of Cyrene**](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) (c. 276 BC – c. 195/194 BC) was a Greek polymath: mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. He invented the discipline of geography, including the terminology used today.
>
> He is best known for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by comparing angles of the mid-day Sun at two places a known North-South distance apart.  His calculation was remarkably accurate. He was also the first to calculate the tilt of the Earth's axis, again with remarkable accuracy.  Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day.  He created the first map of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.
